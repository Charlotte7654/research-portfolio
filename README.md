# Zostera capensis Genomics â€“ Lab Projects Showcase

This repository highlights my contributions to the genomics research of *Zostera capensis* as part of the Combrink et al., 2024 study. The work involved bioinformatic analyses, including SNP calling, population genomics, and data processing pipelines.  

For full details and access to the original project code, please visit the [Combrink Zostera capensis scripts and files](https://github.com/vonderHeydenLab/Combrink_Zostera-capensis-scripts-and-files) from the vonderHeydenLab.  

## My Contributions
- Sampled specimens, extracted DNA, and analyzed genomic datasets.  
- Developed reproducible bioinformatics pipelines for population genomic analyses.  
- Generated visualizations and summary statistics for the publication.
